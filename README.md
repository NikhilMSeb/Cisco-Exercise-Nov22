# Cisco-Exercise-Nov22

Git repository to track and share the project built as part of the "Malware URL Lookup" exercise for Cisco Cloud Security recruiting.  

The question statement can be found [here](https://github.com/NikhilMSeb/Cisco-Exercise-Nov22/blob/main/URL%20Lookup%20Service%20Coding%20Exercise.pdf)

There are 2 ways I have completed this exercise:

1. HTML-based implementation (initial idea)
2. JSON-based implementation 

Both implemenations cover the requirements of the Malware URL lookup as required, with all the other necessary peripherals. Each can be accessed in the respective directories, and each directory has a dedicated README explaining what needs to be done to setup, run and test the service in each case.
