# Cisco-Exercise-Nov22

Git repository to track and share the project built as part of the "Malware URL Lookup" exercise for Cisco Cloud Security recruiting.  

The question statement can be found [here](https://github.com/NikhilMSeb/Cisco-Exercise-Nov22/blob/main/URL%20Lookup%20Service%20Coding%20Exercise.pdf)

There are 2 ways I have completed this exercise:

1. HTML-based implementation (initial idea) - output is delivered in web pages through a portal (i.e. browsers)
    * Rationale: provides the expected underlying functionality but with explicit visual cues (which I thought suits a "coding exercise" more)

2. JSON-based implementation - output is delivered as JSON objects 
    * Rationale: more geared towards working as an API service that can be used by other services as an endpoint directly 

Both implemenations cover the requirements of the Malware URL lookup as described in the problem statement, with all the other necessary peripherals. Each can be accessed in the respective directories, and each directory has a dedicated README explaining what needs to be done to setup, run and test the service in each case, as well as answering further questions posed in the exercise.
